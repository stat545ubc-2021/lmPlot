STAT 545B 2021 Assignments - Eve Chen
================================

This repository will contain **Eve (Yixuan) Chen**'s work for assignments of *STAT 545B* (Winter term 1 2021). 

Some activities so far include:
* Assignment B-1: Making and testing a function

## Files in the repository ðŸ“‚:

Work and report for each assignment is distributed in seperate folders in this repository. Each folder would contain: `1.` the R markdown files with source code, `2.` the knitted markdown files, and `3.` a sub-folder of attached files like figures from the knitted markdown.

**Instructions on how to open and render the markdown (`.md`) and R markdown (`.rmd`) filesï¼š**
- [x]  `.md` files : The markdown files are knitted from the R markdown, it can be read and edited with a normal text editor. But the robust and reproducible way is to edit on the source code in R markdown file of the same name, then knit and update the corresponding markdown file.
- [x] `.rmd` files: The R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. You can use Integrated Development Environment like RStudio to open the files, edit and run the code embedded. You can also render the files into markdown, HTML or PDF formats with RStudio IDE.
